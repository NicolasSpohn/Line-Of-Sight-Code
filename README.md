I am a UCF student majoring in game design with a focus in the programming track.

This is the code for the game I helped program in my game production class at UCF. It is a game where you have to maneuver your way around a lab without getting caught by an enemy with a weeping angel mechanic. I was one of two programmers in this group and I was mostly in charge of code relating to the player controller.
